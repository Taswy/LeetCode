## 问题

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

分析：

股票买卖，要求买卖只有一次，而且遵循先买后买，求出最大利润。

实际上是找出最大差，转换成最大子串和的问题。

## java

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int res = 0; //最少为0
        int opt = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++){
            int subPrice = prices[i] - prices[i-1];
            opt = Math.max(subPrice, opt + subPrice);
            res = Math.max(opt, res);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
