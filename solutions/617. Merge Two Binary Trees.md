## 617. Merge Two Binary Trees

Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not.

You need to merge them into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of new tree.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
	Tree 1                     Tree 2                  
          1                         2                             
         / \                       / \                            
        3   2                     1   3                        
       /                           \   \                      
      5                             4   7                  
Output: 
Merged tree:
	     3
	    / \
	   4   5
	  / \   \ 
	 5   4   7

```

**Note:** The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees.

### 分析

题意大概是让让两棵树的对应节点的值相加,当然如果其中一个为空,那么这个节点的结果必然是另外一个非零节点.很容易可以看出，这个问题可以分成子问题，即只看当前节点，然后其左右节点分别是另外的子问题。

### solution

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode mergeTrees(TreeNode t1, TreeNode t2) {
        if(t1==null && t2==null)
            return null;
        if(t1 != null && t2 == null)
            return t1;
        if(t1 == null && t2 != null)
            return t2;
        //都不是null
        TreeNode t = new TreeNode(t1.val + t2.val);
        t.left = mergeTrees(t1.left, t2.left);
        t.right = mergeTrees(t1.right, t2.right);
        return t;
    }   
}
```
