## 657. Judge Route Circle

Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to **the original place**.

The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character. The valid robot moves are `R` (Right), `L`(Left), `U` (Up) and `D` (down). The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "UD"
Output: true

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "LL"
Output: false

```

### analyze

U=D,R=L就走回了原点.

### solution

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean judgeCircle(String moves) {
        int u = 0, d = 0, r = 0, l = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < moves.length(); i++){
            switch(moves.charAt(i)){
                case 'U': u++; break;
                case 'L': l++; break;
                case 'R': r++; break;
                case 'D': d++; break;
            }
        }
        return u == d && r == l;
    }
}
```
