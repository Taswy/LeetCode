## 问题

You're given strings `J` representing the types of stones that are jewels, and `S` representing the stones you have.  Each character in `S`is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in `J` are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in `J` and `S` are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so `"a"` is considered a different type of stone from `"A"`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0

```

**Note:**

- `S` and `J` will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
- The characters in `J` are distinct.



### 分析

在stones中找到jewels是一个元素查找问题,使用Hash来解决.

由于Map中不能有基本类型,所以这里的char类型写成其装箱形式Character.

## java

```java
class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String J, String S) {
        Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<Character, Integer>();
        for(int i = 0; i < J.length(); i++){
            map.put(J.charAt(i), i);
        }
        int result = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < S.length(); i++){
            if (map.containsKey(S.charAt(i)))
                result ++;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
