# 476. Number Complement

Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

**Note:**

1. The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
2. You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer’s binary representation.



**Example 1:**

```
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
```

### solution

将数字按照二进制位反置.

### java

```java
class Solution {
    public int findComplement(int num) {
        int res = 0;
        int pow = 0;
        while(num != 0){
            int bit = num % 2 == 1? 0 : 1;
            res += bit * Math.pow(2, pow++);
            num /= 2;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
